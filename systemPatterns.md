# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The application follows a modern, scalable architecture that separates concerns and allows for future expansion. The architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **Client Application**: The frontend built with Next.js, utilizing React for UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
2. **API Gateway**: Handles requests from the client and routes them to the appropriate backend services.
3. **Backend Services**: Includes services for authentication, account management, content generation, and lexical analysis.
4. **Databases**: Stores user profiles, account settings, generated content, and historical data.
5. **External Services**: Integrates with AI services for content generation and image processing.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Framework**: Next.js was chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities and ease of use with React.
- **TypeScript**: Used for static typing, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Selected for its utility-first approach, allowing for rapid styling and responsiveness.
- **Radix UI**: Utilized for accessible and customizable UI components.
- **AI Integration**: Plans to integrate with OpenAI for text generation and Midjourney for image generation.
- **Database**: MongoDB is chosen for its flexible schema, accommodating various content types and user preferences.

## Design Patterns
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Promotes reusability and separation of concerns in the UI.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's built-in state management along with context for global state.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is usable across different devices and screen sizes.
